Dear CS 437 and SEC 537 Students,

Please note that the additional homework has been cancelled. Instead, the monitoring component of the assignment has been expanded and is now expected to be more detailed and actionable.

You are required to design and implement a monitoring system capable of detecting, recording, and classifying potential attacks across all relevant attack vectors. This includes, but is not limited to:
-Vulnerable and patched endpoints
-Login and authentication pages
-Directory and file brute-force attempts
-Cookie manipulation and session-related attacks
-Any other relevant attack surface in your system

Your logging mechanism must be highly detailed and actionable. Each log entry should include, at a minimum:
-Attack / scan / input metadata
-Classification of the activity 
-Action (to be taken - also ways to reverse this action)

The system must allow an administrator to take action based on these logs. Both manual and automated response mechanisms should be presented (automated actions are optional but strongly encouraged).

In your report and demonstration video, you must clearly explain:
-How the monitoring system was designed and implemented
-How attacks are detected and classified
-How logging and response mechanisms work
-Proof that the system operates correctly in practice

If the report or video does not sufficiently demonstrate these features, the monitoring component will not be accepted.

Both the written report and the video must include the above details.
All source code and supporting materials must be submitted via SUCourse.

Also, for CS 437 students one day extension has been given. 

Best regards,
Orçun
